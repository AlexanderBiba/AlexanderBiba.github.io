# Getting Started with React

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This post covers the basics.

## What is React?

React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components.

## Key Concepts

1. **Components**: Reusable UI building blocks
2. **Props**: Data passed to components
3. **State**: Component-specific data

## Example Component

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}
```

This is a simple example of a React component that takes a `name` prop and displays a greeting.
