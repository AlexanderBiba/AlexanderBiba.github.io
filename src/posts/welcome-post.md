Welcome!  

I’m excited to share this space where I write about software development, projects I’m working on, and insights I gain along the way. All the content you’ll find here is **entirely my own**, reflecting my experiences, thoughts, and perspectives.  

That said, to make my posts clearer and easier to read, I sometimes use AI tools to **proofread and rephrase** sentences for clarity and flow. The ideas, opinions, and technical content are fully authored by me, the AI is just helping me make the writing more polished.  

This blog is for anyone interested in software, coding experiments, 3D printing, and other projects I enjoy exploring. I hope you find the content useful, informative, and occasionally entertaining.  

Thanks for visiting, and I look forward to sharing more soon!
