      <p>
        I'm a hands-on engineer who enjoys turning complex ideas into
        simple, scalable products. I work across the stack with Node.js,
        React, and cloud technologies, always aiming to write code that's
        clean, maintainable, and purposeful. I care about building things
        that actually make an impact — not just ship fast, but last.
